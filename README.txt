I have intended to contribute some open source code for long but have been constrained by school policy and project privacy. 

This repository is an attempt of sharing some fundamental code on various computer vision topics. This might not be the most efficient, most well documented, or most up to date code, but it might help in understanding some fundamentals about the topics included. 

Cheers!
